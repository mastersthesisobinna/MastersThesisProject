Sample Data
====================================================================================================
MainData.csv
17 columns, 49 observations.
Columns represents variables as described above
Observation represents record for each firm contained in the sample.

Sample size in MainData.csv is 49 firms from the S&P 500 firms for the year 2016.

Two data sets extracted from the sample are also used in the study.
(1) randomSample_ROAA_percentWOBGroup.csv - Contains 30 randomly selected firms from the sample including their ROAA
(2) randomSample_ROAE_percentWOBGroup.csv - Contains 30 randomly selected firms from the sample including their ROAE

C:/MastersThesisProject/Data/Financials (dir)
---------> firms (sub.dir)
------------------------>71 Excel file sheets (.xlsx)
---------> financials.csv
---------> RFinancials.R

RFinancials.R contains R code for obtaining data from the 71 Excel file sheet that was used to create the 
financials.csv file. All data contained in the financials.csv file was obtained from the SEC.gov website.



(2)
C:/MastersThesisProject/Data/SP500 (dir)
---------> SP500.csv

SP500.csv contains data of 56 United States technology firms listed in the Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 index
for the year 2016. Data was obtained from the YCharts.com website.



(3)
C:/MastersThesisProject/Data/WOB (dir)
---------> RWOB.R
---------> uncleanWOB.csv
---------> wob.csv

RWOB.R contains R code for obtaining data on technology firms situated in the United States from the 2020 women 
on boards website (2020wob.com). The RWOB.R produces two comma separated values (csv) files: uncleanWOB.csv and 
wob.csv. The uncleanWOB.csv contains the raw data extract from the 2020wob.com website. The wob.csv is the clean
version or formatted data file that was created using the uncleanWOB.csv file.

C:/MastersThesisProject/Data/GatherSource (dir)
---------> GatherFinancials.R
---------> GatherWOB.R
---------> MakeFile.R
---------> MergeData.R

All four R files included in the GatherSource directory is crucial in creating the sample data file (i.e. MainData.csv) needed
for study. The GatherFinancials.R file contains the R code that uses the "Data/Financials/RFinancials.R" or RFinancials.R
file. Running the GatherFinancials.R file will execute the code contained in the RFinancials.R file, which
then creates the "Data/Financials/financials.csv" file. The GatherWOB.R file uses the "Data/WOB/RWOB.R" file.
Running the GatherWOB.R file will execute the code contained in the RWOB.R file, which then creates the two files: 
"Data/WOB/uncleanWOB.csv" and "Data/WOB/wob.csv" files. The MergeData.R file uses the output of GatherFinancials.R
and GatherWOB.R (i.e. financials.csv and wob.csv files respectively) to combine data from both file outputs. Running
the MergeData.R file will create the MainData.csv file (or sample data file for the study). The MakeFile.R file
is the only file that should be executed to create MainData.csv (or sample data file for the study). Running the MakeFile.R
file will execute the GatherFinancials.R, GatherWOB.R, and MergeData.R files and create all necessary csv file needed
for the study. 

WARNING: Although it is possible to run individually each R file to create the data or csv file that are needed for 
the study. However, it is advised that you adhere to running only the MakeFile.R file. Where errors may occur, you
are advised to alter the root directory based on the directory architeture of your system. All research files,
including the data files have been created in a "MastersThesisProject" directory under the C:/ drive or root directory
drive of a Windows 10 Operating System.

---------> variable_description.txt (Variable description file)

In addition to the MainData.csv file created as a result of running the after running the /Data/GatherSource/MakeFile.R file,
there are two other important data files required for the study. Both of these data files are extracted from the MainData.csv
file and are used for futher analysis in the study. These files are "randomSample_ROAA_percentWOBGroup.csv" and
"randomSample_ROAE_percentWOBGroup.csv". 

Access the "C:\MastersThesisProject\Presentation\Article\Analysis\kruskal\randomSamplingForKruskalTest_ROAA_percentWOB" 
and "C:\MastersThesisProject\Presentation\Article\Analysis\kruskal\randomSamplingForkruskalTest_ROAE_percentWOB" files to
learn how the "randomSample_ROAA_percentWOBGroup.csv" and "randomSample_ROAE_percentWOBGroup.csv" files are created.
