One of the primary functions of the board of directors is, the monitoring and controlling of managers in the firm, which is a fundamental concept from the agency theory itself (Jensen \& Meckling, 1976). The role of the board of directors in an agency framework, is to resolve agency problems that may exist between managers and shareholders, by compensating the shareholders or replacing the managers that do not create value to the shareholders of the firm (Fama \& Jensen, 1983). One business case for diversity is that the diversity of the board of directors increases the board's independence. This implies that members of a very diverse board of directors are more likely to ask questions and approach problems differently when dealing with managers than a traditionally or less diverse board of directors will. Therefore, making a more diverse board of directors a better monitor of managers than a less or non-diverse board of directors (Carter, Simkins, \& Simpson, 2003).

From the agency theory, one can assume that there is value from having more women serve on the board of directors, since their presence on the board of directors will make the board more independent and effective at supervising the managers in the firm. However, the agency theory warns that a firm may not achieve any value from simply having women serve on its board of directors. This is likely the case when the women on the board of directors are marginalized from partaking in many of the board of directors' crucial activities that could directly have an impact on the performance of the firm. As more women become increasingly marginalized on the board of directors, chances are that a firm will lose many of the potential values that is assumed to be available in a gender diverse board of directors, such as the board of directors' ability to effectively supervise the managers of the firm (Ibarra, 1993). It is important to note that the agency theory does not provide a clear prediction of the link between the diversity of the board of directors and the performance of the firm. However, the agency theory does not dismiss the possibility that the diversity of the board of directors, could be beneficial in some ways to the firm.
