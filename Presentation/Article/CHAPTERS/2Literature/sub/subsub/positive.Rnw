Campbell and Minguez-Vera (2008) adopted a panel data methodology in their study in order to examine the relationship between female directors' participation and firm's value. Tobin's Q was used in their study as the measure of the firm's value. The sample for their panel data analysis in their study consisted of 68 Spanish firms and 408 observations. The data on the board of directors that was used in their study was obtained from the Spanish stock exchange commission (CNMV). Also, they obtained the accounting data for their study from the SABI database (Iberian Balance Sheet Analysis System). Campbell et al. (2008) found that the diversity of the board of directors has a positive impact on the firm's value. However, they concluded their study by indicating that the presence of a few number of women on the board of directors alone, was not enough as a factor, to have any significant effect on the firm's value. Instead, they suggested that the Spanish firms should focus on balancing the number of women and men on its board of directors, in order to significantly improve the value of the firm.

Using a two-stage least squares regression analysis model, and a sample consisting of 638 Fortune 1000 firms in the year 1997, Carter, Simkins, and Simpson (2003) examined the relationship between the performance of the firm and the gender diversity of the board of directors. The data on the board of directors that was used in their study was obtained from the "Significant Data for Directors 1999: Board Policies and Governance Trends", which was prepared by Directorship. Also, the accounting data for their study was obtained from the COMPUSTAT database. Carter et al. (2003) found a statistically significant positive relationship between the presence of women on the board of directors and the firm's value as measured by Tobin's Q. They concluded their study by suggesting that firms should make more commitments in order to increase the number of women on the board of directors.

Erhardt, Werbel, and Shrader (2003) employed a correlation and regression analysis approach to investigate the relationship between the demographic diversity of the board of directors and the financial performance of the firm. The sample for their study consisted of 112 large firms from across several industries in the United States. The ethnic and gender characteristics of the board of directors was used as the proxy for demographic diversity in their study. They obtained data on the diversity representation in firms from several company reports, which were compiled by Fortune magazine. Financial performance was measured as return on assets (ROA) and return on investment (ROI). Also, they used the Compact Disclosure database to obtain data for the 1993 and 1998 financial record of the firms that were examined in their study. Erhardt et al. (2003) found a significant positive relationship between the percentage of females plus ethnic minorities on the board of directors and the financial performance of the firm, measured as ROA and ROI. The result of their analysis remained after controlling for several industries, such as service and production sector. Erhardt et al. (2003) concluded their study by indicating that a firm's image will improve if it considers increasing the diversity of the board of directors. Therefore, they suggested that firms should strongly consider diversifying its board of directors, regardless of whether or not, the diversity of the board of directors impacts the financial performance of the firm-an approach that critics will attribute as no different from practicing tokenism to enhance a firm's public appeal.
