The presence of women on the board of directors, is often viewed favorably by corporate stakeholders. However, Westphal and Milton (2000) used the social psychology theory to argue that the presence of women on the board of directors could lower social cohesion between groups, thus creating a social barrier among the members of the board, which on the other hand could make it more difficult for the number of female directors who are on the board, to have any positive value to both the board's performance as wells as to the firm's overall performance. The social psychology theory predicts that the individuals who have a majority status in the board (e.g., male directors in most cases), will have the potential to exert an unequal amount of influence in the board's decision making processes than the individuals who have a minority status in the same board (e.g., female directors in this case). Despite the argument by Westphal et al. (2000), which warns of a likely negative effect of board gender diversity on the firm's performance), the social psychology theory still posits that the gender diversity of the board of directors will not impact the board of directors' ability to executes its functions and more so, will not have any influence on the performance of the firm.

Westphal et al. (2000) however suggested that the presence of women on the board of directors may encourage divergent thinking in the decision making process. Consequently, suggesting that a more gender diverse board of directors will produce and enhance creativity, as well as, innovation on the board of directors itself. Although, they also suggested that an increased level of diversity in the board of directors could as well, potentially increase conflict among its members. Lau and Murnighan (1998) suggested that the conflict(s) that arises within the board of directors due to its level of diversity, could only make the decision making process suffer by becoming slower and less effective. Like the contingency theory, which was presented earlier, the social psychological theory and all of its evidence on group dynamics, suggests that the diversity of the board of directors, may lead to either positive or negative influence on the firm's performance depending on what the situation may be.
