One of several propositions to dominate the business case of a gender diverse board of directors is, the notion that female directors provide a unique set of valuable information to both the board and managers, which helps improve the decision-making approach that is undertaken by the board and ultimately, increase the financial performance of the firm (Fama \& Jensen, 1983; Adams \& Ferreira, 2007). A related, but more extensive proposition for the business case of a gender diverse board of directors, follows from the resource dependency theory, which posits that a diverse board will bring diverse perspectives and several nontraditional approaches to problem solving. The resource dependency theory, provides the basis for some of the most convincing theoretical arguments for the business case of a diverse board of directors.

Pfeffer and Salancik (2003) suggested that the board of directors could serve as a linkage between a corporation and other external organizations to address environmental dependencies. They also suggested the following four benefits for the external linkage that is created by the board of directors: (1) directors deliver valuable resources, such as information and expertise to managers, (2) directors facilitate an open channel of communication with constituents of importance to the firm, (3) directors obtain commitments of support from other important organizations or groups in the external environment, and (4) directors create and supply legitimacy for the firm in the external environment.

The resource dependency theory also posits that a diverse board of directors will be capable of providing unique and valuable information to the entire members of the board, as well as, to the firm's top managers, which could improve the decision making process in the firm and ultimately impact the firm's overall performance. The resource dependency theory also suggests that the difference in the diversity of the board of directors, will make it possible for firms to have more access to the labor and product market, as well as, an improved accessibility to a larger and diverse talent pool of human capital resource, which can facilitate for the provision and appointment of more female employees into leadership positions in the firm. Furthermore, the resource dependency theory suggest a more diverse board of directors will send a positive signal to the firm's shareholders, its customer base, and the government as well, in order to publicly indicate that the firm values and understands the importance of having a generally diverse workforce composition (Booth \& Deli, 1999; Agrawal \& Knoeber, 2001).
