Adams and Ferreira (2009) examined the impact of female directors on the financial performance of the firm. The sample for their study consisted of a select number of firms in the Standards and Poor's (S\&P's) 1500 firms from 1996 to 2003. They obtained the data for their study from both the IRRC annual publication and COMPUSTAT ExecuComp database. Adams et al. (2009) found that there is a negative relationship between the percentage of women on the board of directors and the financial performance of the firm, as measure by Tobin's Q. In conclusion, they suggested that firms with an increased gender diverse board of directors, performed worse than firms with a less gender diverse board of directors.

Minguez-Vera and Martin (2011) employed a panel data methodology to investigate the nature of the relationship between female board-membership and financial performance of the firm, as measured by the return on equity (ROE). The data for their study was obtained from the SABI database (Iberian Balance Sheet Analysis System) for the period, 1998 to 2003. Minguez-Vera et al. (2011) found a negative relationship between the presence of women on the board of directors and the financial performance of the firm. The result of their study remained after controlling for a number of named variables, such as level of debt, age of the firm, logarithm of the number of employees, logarithm of total assets, and logarithm of the total number of directors.
