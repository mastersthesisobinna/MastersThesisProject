N. Smith, V. Smith, and Verner (2006) used data for the 2,500 largest firms in Denmark during the period 1993 to 2001, to examine the relationship between the diversity of the board of directors, and several accounting measures of financial performance. They obtained the data for their study from a private Danish data register called, KOB (Kobmandsstandens Oplysningsbureau) and from a second register called, the Statistics Denmark. They found no significant relationship between the gender diversity of the board of directors, and a number of several accounting measures of firm's performance. Nevertheless, they concluded their study by suggesting that firms should have a sufficient talent pool of qualified women, who can fill in the top level positions of the organization, such as the board of directors or any of the available executive positons.

In another Danish study conducted by Rose (2007), a sample of selected Danish firms were used in a cross-sectional analysis to investigate the relationship between women on the board of directors and the financial performance of the firm, as measured by Tobin's Q. Data on the firms, including their financial information, was obtained from the Copenhagen Stock Exchange during the period 1998 to 2001. Rose (2007) found no significant relationship between the number of women on the board of directors, and the financial performance of the firm, as measured by Tobin's Q.

Farrell and Hersch (2005) used the Poisson regression method, as well as, an event study to investigate the addition of women on the board of directors in the United States. The Poisson regression method, was used to analyze a panel of data from 300 Fortune 1000 firms over a ten-year period from 1990 to 1999. They defined the return on assets (ROA) as the measure of the firm's financial performance. Their study was inconclusive, since they were unable to find any relationship between the addition of women to the board of directors and the return on assets. Also, in their study they found no relationship between the addition of women to the board of directors and the market-returns to shareholders.

Shrader, Blackburn, and Iles (1997), used a hierarchical regression method to examine the relationship between the percentage of women on the board of directors and the financial performance of the firm. The financial performance of the firm was measured as the return on sales (ROS), return on assets (ROA), return on investments (ROI), and return on equity (ROE). They obtained the accounting data for their study from the Compact Disclosure database, for a sample of firms in the United States, for the years 1992 and 1993. Shrader et al. (1997) found no significant relationship between the percentage of women on the board of directors, and the financial performance of the firm. This result remained after controlling for total number of managers, total number of top managers, and total number of board members. They explained the result of their analysis by stating that women had the tendency of being assigned (or marginalized) to assignments, which had less impact on the financial performance of the firm. They also explained that having a few number of women on the board of directors, was not enough to yield any significant impact on the financial performance of the firm itself. They also questioned the experience of the women who served on the board of directors; thus suggesting that the little experience of women on the board of directors, may explain why the presence of women on the board of directors had no significant impact on the financial performance of the firms that was used in their study.

Carter, D'Souza, Simkins, and Simpson (2010), used a three-stage least squares regression method to analyze a panel data of 641 different firms, which were listed in the Standard and Poor's (S\&P's) 500 index during the period, 1998 to 2002. Data on directors was obtained from the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) database. Carter et al. (2010) found no significant relationship between any of the gender and performance variables that was used in their study. Also, they did not find any significant relationship between the number of women on board of directors' committees and Tobin's Q, as well as, return on assets, which were both used as a measure of the firm's financial performance. Using the contingency theory to explain the result of their analysis, they indicated that under some conditions, the effect of board diversity on the financial performance on the firm, was varied and thus, understood to be either positive or negative. Therefore, suggesting that the financial value of having women on the board of directors did not always yield the same result under varying situations or time periods. Furthermore, they indicated the changing results of a positive or a negative effect on the financial performance of the firm, may have canceled out over a given period of time; therefore, leaving no measurable result to account for a direct linkage between the diversity of the board of directors and the financial performance of the firm.
