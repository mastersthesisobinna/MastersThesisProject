Terjesen, Sealy, and Singh (2009) used the work of (Becker, 1964) to define the human capital theory as, the individual's value to the organization, in regards to, their wealth of education, work experience, and level of skillsets, which are available and beneficial to the firm The human capital theory predicts that the diversity of the board of directors will have an impact on the firm's performance, as a result of the unique human capital attributes that becomes available from simply having a diverse board of directors. However, the human capital theory warns that the effect of a diverse board of directors on the firm's financial performance could be positive or negative, since it largely depends on the situation, as well as, the approach that a firm has decided to use, in order to derive value from the human capital that is available to them.

This is in accordance with the contingency theory in the sense that the value of the available human capital in one firm at some point in time, may not always remain the same at other given times or situations (Fiedler \& Chemers, 1967; Lawrence \& Lorsch, 1967). In other words, the value of having a woman on the board of directors as a result of her unique set of human capital attributes, may not always result in a positive or negative impact on the firm's financial performance; given how the firm uses the available human capital it has on its board of directors to achieve its targeted financial performance.
