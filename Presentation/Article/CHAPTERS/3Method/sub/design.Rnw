The present study follows a descriptive research approach and employs some nonparametric statistics techniques to analyze the data included in the sample. The selected statistics techniques is based on the normal distribution of the data included in the sample. Nonparametric statistics is applied extensively throughout in the present study to analyze and test the two null-hypotheses stated in the previous chapter (see page \pageref{sec:hypothesis}).
