Our sample for the present study consists of 49-publicly traded-United States technology firms listed in the S\&P 500 firms for the year 2016. Our choice of sample is based on the following reasons: (1) The S\&P 500 firms includes the top 500 publicly traded firms in the United States; (2) the S\&P 500 firms captures approximately 80 percent coverage of available market capitalization in the United States; (3) the S\&P 500 firms is largely regarded by many investors as a good representation of the United States stock market and economy. 

The technology firms included in our sample are all listed in the S\&P 500 firms and are assumed to be among the top 500 firms in the United States. Our choice of sample is considered appropriate for the present study, since we have a financial interest in the investigation of the likely relationship between female directors and firm's financial performance in the context of the United States technology sector.
