We employed the R statistics software to perform the necessary statistical procedures that are required in order to examine the relationship between female directors and financial performance of firms included the sample. The R statistics software combines a comprehensive set of packages for performing nonparametric statistical analysis of the data included in our sample. All statistical analysis, figures, and table reports are generated using the R statistics software. A 0.05 value was set as the standard significance level for the present study. We used our selected standard significance level as the benchmark to interpret the report of our statistical analysis. We interpreted a \emph{p} value greater than 0.05 as not significant. Also, we interpreted a \emph{p} value less than 0.05 as significant.
